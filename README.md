# battleship
A battleship game built with JavaScript. The goal of this project was to become more confident in unit testing, also known as TDD (Test Driven Development). I focused on making sure each test simply passed, and made sure each piece of functionality within the app was separated. Part of The Odin Project's full stack JS curriculum.
